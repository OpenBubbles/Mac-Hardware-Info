# Mac-Hardware-Info

Mac-Hardware-Info is a companion app to [OpenBubbles](https://github.com/TaeHagen/bluebubbles-app/tree/rustpush). This application generates a unique code required for OpenBubbles to function. The code ensures that OpenBubbles can run iMessage on platforms such as Android and Windows by verifying the presence of a genuine Mac.

## Important Notice

- It is recomended to run Mac-Hardware-Info on a **real** mac.
- Running it on a virtual machine or other ways (e.g. a Hackintosh) may lead to problems with OpenBubbles.
